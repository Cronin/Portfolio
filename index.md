## Hi! I'm Claudio Cronin

I'm a Google Ads consultant and my biggest goal is to work with data and I'm switching my career in to it.

I've been always fascinated about programming, during the quarantine I created a funny YouTube bot that made and is making millions of views on YouTube  downloading, editing and ulploading celebrities Instagram Stories on YouTube.

After that I used much of my free time to learn more about programming.
My favourite book to set the basics of coding was an open source python book,Python Learn, then I made little investement buying a really practical and in depth coding site subscription, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science) where I started the Web Developer Path and Data Science to choose between the two.

After the first month I decided to focus completely on Data Science.

After months of hours spent, I finished the coding course aknowledging my passion to Data Science.
The main topics were:

1. Python Fundamentals
2. Data Acquisition
3. Data Manipulation with Pandas
4. Data Wrangling and Tidying
5. Summary Statistics
6. Hypothesis Testing
7. Communicating Data Science Findings
8. Data Visualization
9. Natural Language Processing
10. Supervised Learning
11. Unsupervised Learning
12. Foundations of Deep Learning

## These are the 5 projects I created during the course
