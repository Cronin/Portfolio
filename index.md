## Hi! I'm Claudio Cronin

I'm a Google Ads consultant and my biggest goal is to work with data and I'm switching my career in to it.

I've been always fascinated about programming, during the quarantine I created a ##YouTube bot## that made and is making millions of views on YouTube  downloading, editing and ulploading celebrities Instagram Stories on YouTube.

After that I used much of my free time to learn more about programming.
My favourite book to set the basics of coding was an open source python book,Python Learn, then I made little investement buying a really practical and in depth coding site subscription, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science) where I started the Web Developer Path and Data Science to choose between the two.

After the first month I decided to focus completely on ##Data Science##.

After months of hours spent, I finished the coding course aknowledging my passion to Data Science.
##The main topics were##:

1. Python Fundamentals
2. Data Acquisition
3. Data Manipulation with Pandas
4. Data Wrangling and Tidying
5. Summary Statistics
6. Hypothesis Testing
7. Communicating Data Science Findings
8. Data Visualization
9. Natural Language Processing
10. Supervised Learning
11. Unsupervised Learning
12. Foundations of Deep Learning

## These are the 5 projects I created during the course

# [U.S. Medical Insurance Costs](https://github.com/Cronin/US-medical-insurance-costs)

For this project, I investigate a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file using the Python skills that I developed during the first lessons.

# Project Goals:
- Work locally on your own computer
- Import a dataset into your program
- Analyze a dataset by building out functions or class methods
- Use libraries to assist in your analysis


# [Life Expectancy GDP](https://github.com/Cronin/life-expectancy-gdp)

For this project, I analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

Analyze, prepare, and plot data in order to answer questions in a meaningful way.

# Project Goals:
- Complete a project to add to my portfolio
- Use seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations
- Become familiar with presenting and sharing data visualizations
- Preprocess, explore, and analyze data


# Knowledge required:
- Data Acquisition
- Data Visualization
- Hypothesis Testing
- Summarizing Quantitative Data
- Data Wrangling and Tidying
- Data Manipulation with Pandas

# [Biodiversity](https://github.com/Cronin/biodiversity)

For this project, I will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

I perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, I analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

# [Okcupid Date A Scientist](https://github.com/Cronin/okcupid-date-a-scientist)

In this portfolio project, I analyze some data from OKCupid, an app that focuses on using multiple choice and short answers to match users.

I also create a presentation about my findings from this OKCupid dataset.

The purpose of this project is to practice formulating questions and implementing machine learning techniques to answer those questions.
